These are my dotfiles. You may look, but please do not touch. They bite.

More seriously, despite not being licensed, feel free to steal anything from this repository; I didn't write the programs these are for.

Things:

- I use i3
- Text editor is either nano or [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro)
- I keep track of all the things I forget, and then [scream](../../../AAH) when I can't remember them
